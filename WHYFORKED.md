# Why did we fork this repo?
The owner of the already forked repository stated that if you used it in production to fork it and use your fork.

NOTE: The syntax for this fork is different. See [this pull request](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches/pull/118).
Also note that the `patches-ignore` section does not work in a seperate patch file, it must be in the main composer.json.
